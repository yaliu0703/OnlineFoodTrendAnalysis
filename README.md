**Project description:** 

Early detection of emerging food trends can translate into great business opportunities. Today, a lot of food-related discussions occur on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Thus, such social media content presents a potentially valuable and real-time source of intelligence that can be leveraged by retailers to better serve its customers. The purpose of this project is to explore this possibility using techniques discussed in the social media analytics course. Ultimately, we wish to help retailers see the rise and fall of certain categories of food before competitors do.
